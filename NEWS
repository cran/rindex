		CHANGES IN rindex VERSION 0.11

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	We no longer patch 'match', instead we have 'match.index' and 'match.rindex' 
	that need to be called directly (wish of CRAN maintainer). 
	Without the patch we cannot S3 method dispatch because the crucial argument 
	in match is 'table', not 'x'. 

    o	We no longer provide %in%.



BUG FIXES

    o	prebuild.sh no longer tries to execute a non-existing path
